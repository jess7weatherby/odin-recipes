    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Make burgers your way and have them come out flawless every time with what I consider to be the Best Hamburger Patty Recipe, in my humble opinion.<br>
        It’s a classic all-American recipe for mouthwatering burgers that can be cooked on the grill, on the stovetop, as thick 1/3 pound patties, or as  <br>
        ultra-thin griddle patties. Get ready, because you are about to make the burger of your dreams, people!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 2 lbs. ground chuck, <i>80%</i></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1/2 cup <u><b>crushed saltine crackers</b></u> <i>or Panko breadcrumbs</i></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1 large egg</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 2 tablespoons <u><b>Worcestershire sauce</b></u></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 2 tablespoons <u><b>milk</b></u></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1 teaspoon <u><b>salt</b></u></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1 teaspoon <u><b>garlic powder</b></u></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1 teaspoon <u><b>onion powder</b></u> </li>
        <li><input type="checkbox"> 1/2 teaspoon <u><b>black pepper</b></u></li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out a large mixing bowl. Add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. 
            <br> Mix by hand until the meat mixture is smooth, but stop once the mixture looks even. (Overmixing can create a dense heavy texture.)</li>
        <li>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet
            <br> patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
        <li>Set out a <u><b>baking sheet</b></u>, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into <br>
            patties. Shape them just slightly larger than the buns you plan to use, to account for shrinkage during cooking. Set the patties on the<br>
            baking sheet. Use a spoon to press a dent in the center of each patty so they don't puff up as they cook. If you need to stack the patties <br>
            separate them with a sheet of wax paper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat. (Approximately 350-400 degrees F.)</li>
        <li><u><b>For thick patties:</b></u> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li><u><b>For thin patties:</b></u> Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stack the hot patties on hamburgers buns, and top with your favorite hamburgers toppings. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
