This project is to give great recipes to the public. 
Up to this point I will be using what I have learned from the Odin Project.
I will setup up my index.html file and then code my boilerplate to setup this website for people to see these great recipes.
By using my knowledge of lists, emphasis, strong, and paragraph attribuytes I will setup a website that allows people to easily access recipes and by adding links using a href and images, my intention is to make it clean and interactive.
